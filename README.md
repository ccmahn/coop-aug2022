# Co-op Summer 2022 

## Description
Code from my IT co-op term in summer 2022, as a Business Systems Analyst @ Nova Scotia Power. Had a task from the Work Asset Management team to write a script to manage their field service users. I utilized PowerShell to create a script that will extract usernames from an Excel file and query the Active Directory, to verify which users exist in a specified work group.
